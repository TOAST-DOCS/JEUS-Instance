## Application Service > JEUS Instance > Overview
JEUS Instance, a newly-launched service, has significantly enhanced performance for processing of high-volume transactions, support for cloud computing, analyzing and reporting service status, and other development and operation features that are required by the market.

### Main Features
#### Zero-Downtime Deployment
Provides a zero-downtime service environment that ensures the completion of requests from pre-deployment sessions when application redeployment is required, saving time and cost and improving development productivity.

#### In-Memory JSP Compilation
For a JSP application that is changed, compiles it in memory to reduce the initial service time. This can reduce the load from file I/O operations by using JSP through memory instead of file.

#### JEUS Hot Swap
Significantly improves development productivity by redefining only the changed class without having to reload the entire classes when an application function is changed. Effectively used for adding and removing class constructors, and changing method bodies.

#### Convenience for Developer/Administrator
JEUS 8 has improved convenience for developers and administrators by adding the user library management feature and the template feature to create servers in the cluster environment automatically.

### Service Targets
* Enterprise customers who want high-volume transactions and clustering
* Enterprise customers who want to improve development productivity with continuous service environment
* When you provide a web service based on a high availability and high performance architecture
